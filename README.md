# 2D_StructuralFrame_Analysis_ByUsing_Stiffness_Method
In this script, The application of the stiffness method has been used for frame analysis to calculate the unknown values of the structure rather than the other methods due to the computational issues. The main idea is that the creation of the member stiffness matrix must be set up by formulation. These member stiffnesses depend on the modulus of elasticity, a moment of inertia, and beam section area. Thanks to python programming, processes will be understood well. Then, the system stiffness matrix will be created and then other calculations just as displacement, reaction, and other unknown.
Note: If you want to check result,run the SAP2000 Model and see the results for comparation.
